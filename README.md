# Analyzing textual data with word embeddings in Python

This is the repo that comes with a handbook article on computational text analysis with Python. We chose a small dataset for the sake of clarity. However, the code and methods can also be applied to bigger datasets.

The repo provides a fully self-contained example of how to generate and cluster word embeddings of text data.
