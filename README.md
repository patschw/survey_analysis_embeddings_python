# Analyzing textual data with word embeddings in Python

This is the repo that comes with a handbook article on computational text analysis with Python. We chose a small dataset for the sake of clarity. However, the code and methods can also be applied to bigger datasets.

The repo provides a fully self-contained example of how to generate and cluster word embeddings of text data.

The repo contains two files:  
**cluster_word_embeddings_example.ipynb**: The Juypter notebook with code to reproduce the handbook example yourself.
**survey_queries_cluster.csv**: The data needed to run the notebook.

Feel free to adapt the code to your needs!

When using the code please cite our handbook contribution as follows:
